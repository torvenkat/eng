| Ecowitt |    1     | Ethernet   | ??          | I purchased this a while ago.   This contains an indoor and an outdoor temperature and humidity sensor.  One of the best low-cost personal weather stations, IMHO.  This is modular and extensible (rain, wind, particle, lightining sensors...)Yet to find a good way to integrate. |
| WeeWx   |    1     | Ethernet   | ??          | Configured for the Ecowitt.  There are scripts available to integrate with HA, yet to do that. |
