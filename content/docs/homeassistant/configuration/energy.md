### Time-of-Use Rates

I subscribe to Toronto Electricity Board's Time of Use energy rate.  This enables Peak, Mid-Peak, and Off-Peak rates. The rate periods also change during according to the seasons.  

I use [Ontario Energy Board](https://github.com/jrfernandes/ontario_energy_board) integration through HACS.  

I plan to set up a small LED indicator to denote Green (off-peak), Blue (mid-peak), and Red (peak) rates so that we can quickly decide to run energy-intensive appliances such as dish washer, washing machine, & dryer.  Tesla is programmed to always change during nights when the rate if off-peak.
